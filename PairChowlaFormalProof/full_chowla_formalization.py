# --- 1. Define the Full Chowla Conjecture as the ultimate goal ---

# The full Chowla conjecture states that for any k >= 1 and any distinct non-zero integers h_1, ..., h_k,
# the sum of lambda(n) * lambda(n+h_1) * ... * lambda(n+h_k) tends to 0 as N -> infinity.
# For this formalization, we focus on the implication from the fractional calculus approach.

    Atom("Sum_{n <= N} " + str(lambda_n) + " * " + str(lambda_n_plus_h)),
    Atom("o(N)")
)

# --- 2. Combine the proofs ---

# The proof of the full Chowla conjecture from this approach relies on:
# 1. The properties of Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) as a Gaussian process.
# 2. The vanishing of higher-order cumulants of fractionally-integrated Liouville increments.
# 3. The connection between vanishing cumulants and the Chowla conjecture.
