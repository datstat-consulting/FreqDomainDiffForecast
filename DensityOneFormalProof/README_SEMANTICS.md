# Toward full analytic semantics

This starter pack shows **how** to move from a proof-shape checker to **real, semantic** verification of
analytic statements used in your paper.

## What’s included

- `semantics_discrete.py` — exact finite Fourier analysis
  - additive character orthogonality on ℤ/qℤ (no floats)
  - geometric series over roots of unity
  - unitary DFT + Parseval check (small vectors)

- `semantics_measure_skeleton.py` — roadmap + scaffolding for continuous analysis
  - interval arithmetic primitives (rigorous enclosures)
  - Lebesgue integral via simple functions (prototype)
  - hooks for L²([0,1]) + trigonometric basis (TODO)
  - bridge functions your checker can call to *semantically* validate atoms

## Minimal viable path to “full semantics” for your proof

1. **Discrete layer (done):** exact orthogonality/Parseval on finite groups → supports bilinear dispersion rigorously.
2. **Intervals (implement):** add certified `exp/log/sin/cos` enclosures; compose to bound errors.
3. **Lebesgue integral:** represent measurable sets as finite unions of intervals; build simple functions; prove MCT/DCT.
4. **L²([0,1]) Fourier:** show `{e_n}` is orthonormal via exact integrals; prove Parseval on trig polynomials; extend by density.
5. **Dirichlet polynomials & MR pipeline:** formalize mean-square identities using step (4); implement Halász/pretentious distance with certified prime sums (intervals for logs).
6. **Bridge to checker:** for each rule (e.g., “Bessel/Plancherel”), add a **semantic verifier** that replays the identity within the semantics library and returns `True`.

This gives you a **hybrid** system: proofs proceed as they do now, but every analytic step is backed by a semantic replay with validated numerics or exact algebra.
